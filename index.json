I graduated from university, got my first job, and moved to a new one, the second one being my first international experience within the programming industry. While working, I also continued the development of my graduation thesis with the help of my friend and mentor Edil Medeiros. All these experiences were great on their own, but they don\u0026rsquo;t even get close to how good the idea of a study group was.","tags":["lesson"],"title":"My best idea of 2022"},{"date":"2021-07-30","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/circularprogramming/","summary":"Disclaimer I created this post during the make of my graduation project more than one and half years ago. This post served as training of a topic I had the intention of talking about in the final thesis \u0026ndash; something that ended up not happening. I\u0026rsquo;ve made a presentation on Dr.Nekoma about the topic, given how interesting it is.
