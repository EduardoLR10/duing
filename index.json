I\u0026rsquo;ve graduated in computer engineering in 2022 at University of Brasília.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve started programming by changing IDs of itens and blocks in Minecraft mods back in the day. Later on, at the final stretch at university, I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered myself as an addicted person to computer science.\nAfter such discovery, I\u0026rsquo;ve started to slowly increase the number of personal projects.","tags":[],"title":"About"},{"date":"2023-01-15","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/publications/","summary":" J.

The plan was for me to make a toy example of one of the professor\u0026rsquo;s ideas using this library because of its power and generality.\nPrior to this project, I presented the subject for the class based on the original paper published by Simon and Ralf. My impression after the reading, which is also the one that I attempted to portray to my peers, is that the usefulness of the method came at the cost of complexity of understanding and the use of unsafe operations.","tags":["lesson","technical"],"title":"Don't be a Hero, join a League"},{"date":"2023-07-09","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/beyondhackers/","summary":"The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric S. Raymond is a perfect union of philosophy, economics, and software development culture. The reverberations of his theory are fascinating and explain much more than just why you should care about open-source software.\nNeedless to say that I highly recommend the reading, there are aspects that he identified within the Hacker Culture that explain more than meets the naked eye. I\u0026rsquo;m here to suggest a few possible explanations for such observations and how the connection between those aspects and a hacker is more than just making money via coding.","tags":["lesson","recommendation"],"title":"Beyond Hackers"},{"date":"2023-03-06","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/masters/","summary":"Starting in March, I will start a master\u0026rsquo;s program at University of Brasília, the same university where I graduated almost a year ago. The thought process that I went in order to make such a decision is not conventional and I think it is worth sharing it.\nSoftware Industry As we know, the software industry values academic achievements only in very specific situations, usually involving big companies with very complicated projects to push, such as the next Apple M3 processor and Windows 12 at Microsoft.","tags":["lesson"],"title":"Why Masters?"}],
