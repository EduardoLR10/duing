I\u0026rsquo;ve graduated in computer engineering in 2022 at University of Brasília.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve started programming by changing IDs of items and blocks in Minecraft mods back in the day. Later on, at the final stretch at university, I discovered that computer science is addicting.\nAfter such discovery, I\u0026rsquo;ve started to slowly increase the number of personal projects.

As an example, this week such a situation occurred \u0026mdash; I heard someone saying something along those lines about Haskell. They see the added abstractions as a way to add fanciness for the sake of fanciness into your project, without any logical practical reason for doing so.\nEver since I understood why programmers left assembly languages behind, I understood that this popular take is nothing more than just a misconception on why we seek new concepts.","tags":["lesson"],"title":"Let us all be Pragmatists"},{"date":"2023-09-30","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/story/","summary":"When you find the same principle being applied to multiple domains, with completely different contexts, that is when you gotta watch out for such a principle. Ask yourself: how universal is this? Should I expect it to appear again in a domain near these ones? How easily does it spread to other ideas?\nI suffered from this internal questioning after reading Building a StoryBrand by Donald Miller, a suggestion from my friend Eduardo Bellani.","tags":["lesson","recommendation"],"title":"Is it all about the Story?"},{"date":"2023-09-01","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/teaching/","summary":"During my vacation time from University, my mentor Edil proposed I teach undergraduate students in the following semester. He would be doing the third edition of his Functional Programming (FP) with Haskell course \u0026ndash; the one that introduced me to FP in 2021. The idea was that he would give me some guidelines and I would have the freedom to create my own material and teaching strategy for the first 2 classes of the course.","tags":["lesson"],"title":"Teaching is Fun"}],
