Currently, I work for FPComplete as a software engineer writing Haskell and Nix.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve started programming by changing IDs of itens and blocks in Minecraft mods back in the day. Later on, at the final stretch at university, I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered myself as an addicted person to computer science.","tags":[],"title":"About"},{"date":"2023-01-15","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/publications/","summary":" J.

How, now that I\u0026rsquo;m much older than back then, I see that the movie showed to me that art is much more important that I thought. How, even in my profession, there can be a noble purpose.\nRetrospective Sometimes we remember our infancy. We remember the toys we used to play with, the people we used to interact with, the lessons that we learned along the way (usually in the most painful way), and also we remember what we used to watch.","tags":["entertainment","lesson"],"title":"Do we still care about Art?"},{"date":"2023-01-15","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/bestidea2022/","summary":"During 2022, a lot of things happened. I graduated from university, got my first job, and moved to a new one, the second one being my first international experience within the programming industry. While working, I also continued the development of my graduation thesis with the help of my friend and mentor Edil Medeiros. All these experiences were great on their own, but they don\u0026rsquo;t even get close to how good the idea of a study group was.","tags":["lesson"],"title":"My best idea of 2022"},{"date":"2021-09-11","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/fixingrecursion/","summary":"Disclaimer I created this post during the make of my graduation project more than one and half years ago. This post served as training of a topic I had the intention of talking about in the final thesis \u0026ndash; something that ended up not happening.
