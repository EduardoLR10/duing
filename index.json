I\u0026rsquo;ve graduated in computer engineering in 2022 at University of Brasília.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve started programming by changing IDs of itens and blocks in Minecraft mods back in the day. Later on, at the final stretch at university, I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered myself as an addicted person to computer science.\nAfter such discovery, I\u0026rsquo;ve started to slowly increase the number of personal projects.","tags":[],"title":"About"},{"date":"2023-01-15","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/publications/","summary":" J.

Ask yourself: how universal is this? Should I expect it to appear again in a domain near these ones? How easily does it spread to other ideas?\nI suffered from this internal questioning after reading Building a StoryBrand by Donald Miller, a suggestion from my friend Eduardo Bellani.","tags":["lesson","recommendation"],"title":"Is it all about the Story?"},{"date":"2023-09-01","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/teaching/","summary":"During my vacation time from University, my mentor Edil proposed I teach undergraduate students in the following semester. He would be doing the third edition of his Functional Programming (FP) with Haskell course \u0026ndash; the one that introduced me to FP in 2021. The idea was that he would give me some guidelines and I would have the freedom to create my own material and teaching strategy for the first 2 classes of the course.","tags":["lesson"],"title":"Teaching is Fun"},{"date":"2023-08-21","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/ooptypeclasses/","summary":"The main benefit of exploring different programming paradigms is to learn how to build bridges. You have your preferences and by playing with the competitors, you are able to see where your preferences fall apart and vice-versa. Eventually, the mastery of both sides will allow you to syntatically and semantically connect the same concepts across different worlds of programming.\nThe story goes as follows: suppose you have a function that is generic enough in order to be worth it to generalize it to other types of structures, given that some constraints on it will be guaranteed.","tags":["technical"],"title":"OOP-style Typeclasses"}],
