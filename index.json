I\u0026rsquo;ve graduated in computer engineering in 2022 at University of Brasília.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve started programming by changing IDs of items and blocks in Minecraft mods back in the day. Later on, at the final stretch at university, I discovered that computer science is addicting.\nAfter such discovery, I\u0026rsquo;ve started to slowly increase the number of personal projects.

Although most of the time when programming we are interacting with language-specific features, some ideas float beyond any palpable implementation.\nThus, it is important to not only distinguish those but also to identify which ones we should use to create defaults when approaching other technologies. This, however, isn\u0026rsquo;t to say we will be unconditionally married to them \u0026ndash; effectively transforming them into dogmas.","tags":["lesson"],"title":"Don't make all defaults Dogmas"},{"date":"2024-02-27","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/firsttimeleader/","summary":"In the past three weeks, I led a team of developers, some would even call it a \u0026ldquo;Tech Lead\u0026rdquo; role.
