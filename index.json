I\u0026rsquo;ve graduated in computer engineering in 2022 at University of Brasília.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve started programming by changing IDs of items and blocks in Minecraft mods back in the day. Later on, at the final stretch at university, I discovered that computer science is addicting.\nAfter such discovery, I\u0026rsquo;ve started to slowly increase the number of personal projects.

And I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about it being hard, or overpaid, or any sort of work/life balance (whatever that may be, I\u0026rsquo;ll let you define). Usually the topic on-hand is about the life of the developer being miserable as the standard, which in return has as symptom the many videos on youtube about burnout, career changes, and overall mental life crisis that a lot of developers share.","tags":["lesson","technical"],"title":"Hopeful Abstractions"},{"date":"2024-12-01","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/generalistspecialist/","summary":"The title of this post is a thesis \u0026ndash; an idea that I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure it is true for certain but I want to have a record of its details written somewhere.\nIt has been a while since I have these thoughts floating around in my head.
