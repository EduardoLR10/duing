      <description>I help tech companies end the nightmare of having to pick between the triad of software: performance, functionality, and maintenance. There is no need to pick, you can have it all. My fascination with computer science, with a focus on functional programming, will settle your project in peace, without any stress, extra working hours, and regret. Regardless of the tool and nature of your company, you will have in your hands something that works, performs great and you will be proud of how maintainable it is.</description>
