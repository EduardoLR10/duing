<p>At the time of this writing I&rsquo;m burned out. I had no doubt it was a thing and
that it could happen to anyone. However, I couldn&rsquo;t see myself suffering from
this. At least not so soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burnout is caused when you repeatedly make large amounts of sacrifice and or
effort into high-risk problems that fail. It&rsquo;s the result of a negative
prediction error in the nucleus accumbens. You effectively condition your brain
to associate work with failure. &mdash; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5630618">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty active for the past 4 to 5 years due to college, courses, work
and other activities. Yet all of this haven&rsquo;t bothered me in the slightest,
until now. I couldn&rsquo;t take control of basic chores, missed the point of meetings
after a few moments, had no will to leave the bed and many other things.
Moreover, It&rsquo;s a strange feeling with predefined steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>You know what you have to do;</li>
<li>You know it&rsquo;s within your capabilities;</li>
<li>You get excited to do the task;</li>
<li>Your body just <em>will not do it</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There you go, you now have the recipe to fight against yourself for a whole day.
This will be a excruciating battle until you hit the bed and repeat it the next
morning. That is, if you aren&rsquo;t already going to sleep late due to forcing
yourself to be productive throughout the day. Realizing I was battling my own
was really important to improve my situation. I started by cleaning my room,
then exercising, putting a alarm to tell me when to eat and so on. My next step
was to change my whole environment by looking after a new job.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m not in position to take a sabbatical period of time to discover
new hobbies or a new career - and I don&rsquo;t want to, as I love my current
profession. So, what&rsquo;s left to ponder to change this situation, I may ask
myself? To be honest, I have no clue. While I&rsquo;m in the process to land a new job
I feel that this might be the response I needed to this feeling. New challenges,
new people, new technologies and new everything.</p>
