<p>Some time ago <a href="/blog/2022/building-a-dell-poweredge-t410-nas-with-nixos-and-zfs/">I built a NAS for personal usage</a>. It has been a blessing
in my life as I&rsquo;m not afraid of losing data or going out of storage
anymore. However, due to some unfortunate events, I don&rsquo;t have a place
to run it other than my bedroom, but it is too noisy to keep it beside
my bed.</p>
<p>I decided to migrate the server to a smaller form so that I could rest
comfortable without a running computer on my ears. Interestingly, in
Brazil we don&rsquo;t have much options for small factor cases such as ITX.
Considering that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to build it my own, I decided to
go with a Synology DS1520+.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m going to be honest here, the software is absolutely awesome.
Personally, I don&rsquo;t like to use closed-source software (and I&rsquo;ll show
you one of the reasons in a few moments), but the disk and backup
management is way better than something I could come up with. I don&rsquo;t
know how long they will support my model and its software but for the
time being I&rsquo;m enjoying it.</p>
<p>Partitioning and formatting was always a struggle for me as I can&rsquo;t
decide for myself if I should go with Btrfs or ZFS; which RAID setup
or how many datasets to create. This was all automatically handled for
me.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>This is the part that sucks the most about the device. I mean, the
hardware is definitely reasonable for its original use case: file
storage. It has a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/197305/intel-celeron-processor-j4125-4m-cache-up-to-2-70-ghz/specifications.html">Celeron J4125</a> with 8GB DDR4 ECC RAM (up to 20GB).
This is more than enough for my needs.</p>
<p>What about the noise? I can&rsquo;t hear it at all! The only noise that it
introduces to the room is actually from it hard-drives, but nothing
loud enough to disrupt my sleep as it&rsquo;s barely noticeable.</p>
<p>Something that I think I shouldn&rsquo;t have bought is the NVMe drive for
caching. I thought that by running a bunch of media software I&rsquo;d get
better performance caching reads on the SSD. Well, it turns out that I
don&rsquo;t actually have this much reads and I only hit a cache of 5GB on a
daily-basis.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-containers">What about the containers?</h2>
<p>Synology provides an official Docker application at its <em>Package
Center</em> that you can just install and go crazy with it&hellip; or not. I
might have done everything wrong and tried to circumvent the software
in a way that is not recommended. However, every time I tried to run a
container that exposes an HTTP server, I got redirected to the port
<code>5000</code> by my device&rsquo;s NGINX. I spent a ridiculous amount of time
trying to change this behavior but I thought that it would be easier
to setup this in a way that I&rsquo;m used to.</p>
<h3 id="alpine-linux-for-the-rescue">Alpine Linux for the rescue</h3>
<p>Feeling defeated by Synology&rsquo;s software, I decided to try a <em>different
approach</em>: a regular Linux distribution. As my
hardware is really limited, I want to use as less resources as
possible. For this reason I chose to go with <a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> as the
backbone of my virtual machine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing novel about running containers with Docker and
<code>docker-compose</code>, so I&rsquo;m not going to dig deeper on setting this up.</p>
<h4 id="using-nfs-as-the-storage">Using NFS as the storage</h4>
<p>Docker has a poorly documented way of setting up an NFS share directly
on the container and due to this I assume they don&rsquo;t want you to use
this feature üòú. Anyway, mounting an NFS share is much easier than
going trial and error with docker volumes over NFS.</p>
<p>I created the NFS share on Synology&rsquo;s dashboard and then on my alpine
machine I ran:</p>
<div class="highlight">
    <span class="highlight-type">shell</span>
    <pre><code class="language-shell hljs" data-lang="shell">  mkdir -p /mnt/docker
  mount -t nfs &lt;ip&gt;:/volume1/&lt;share-dir&gt; /mnt/docker</code></pre>
</div>

<style>
    .highlight-type {
        content: "shell";
        position: absolute;
        opacity: 0.5;
    }
</style><p>I also added this line on my <code>/etc/fstab</code> file to automatically mount
the NFS volume after boot:</p>
<div class="highlight">
    <span class="highlight-type">shell</span>
    <pre><code class="language-shell hljs" data-lang="shell">  &lt;ip&gt;:/volume1/&lt;share-dir&gt; /mnt/docker nfs _netdev 0 0</code></pre>
</div>

<style>
    .highlight-type {
        content: "shell";
        position: absolute;
        opacity: 0.5;
    }
</style><p>This might not be obvious at this point, but doing things this way is
awesome because I can just mount volumes pointing to <code>/mnt/docker</code> and
backup them through <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/hyper_backup">Hyper Backup</a> on <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze B2</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight">
    <span class="highlight-type">yaml</span>
    <pre><code class="language-yaml hljs" data-lang="yaml">  caddy:
    image: caddy:2.6
    # ...
    volumes:
      - /mnt/docker/caddy/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      # ...</code></pre>
</div>

<style>
    .highlight-type {
        content: "yaml";
        position: absolute;
        opacity: 0.5;
    }
</style><p>This setup gives me the most out of everything I tried so far:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Flexibility</dt>
<dd>I configure my services through a regular Linux
system with extensive documentation.</dd>
<dt>Security</dt>
<dd>Hyper Backup assures me things are backed up correctly.</dd>
<dt>Portability</dt>
<dd>They are regular containers, I can easily migrate to another host</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My current experience has been positive. Although, I&rsquo;m still kind of
skeptical about the longevity of the backup software. It is easy to
use and makes incremental backups a breezy to setup, but I still want
the freedom to restore on a Linux server without much trouble. Well,
this is mostly a personal desire and I understand this device was not
made for my use case! üòÅ</p>
