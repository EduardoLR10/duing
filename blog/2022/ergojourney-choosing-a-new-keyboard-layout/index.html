  <h2>ErgoJourney - Choosing a new keyboard layout

  </h2><p>After multiple injuries to my right wrist due to a multitude of activities
(sports, bad typing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and an <em>act of god</em>) I decided to change my keyboard layout
to one that could possibly demand less work off of my hands.</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s go through a small history of keyboards I&rsquo;ve previously used.
Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t actually have pictures of them as I don&rsquo;t have the habit
to take pictures of things (which I should reconsider!). Briefly, the complete
list is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>IBM Model M</li>
<li>ThinkPad X230</li>
<li>HyperX Alloy FPS Pro (Cherry MX Blue)</li>
<li>Keychron K2V2 (Cherry MX Red)</li>
<li>Corne V3 (failed attempt, the PCB wasn&rsquo;t delivered)</li>
<li>SZA Moonlander Mark I</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="previously-used-keyboards">Previously used keyboards</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the keyboards I have owned for the past decade.
There was a place near (SÃ£o Paulo is huge but everything is close if you can
walk to the subway) my work called <em>Santa EfigÃªnia</em>. At the time, this was the
biggest place to go look after tech gadgets here in SÃ£o Paulo.</p>
<p>As all places like this, there were a lot of second-hand shops. Places that
bought boxes after boxes of old corporate hardware. And this is how I got my
hands on an <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard">IBM Model M</a></strong>! I&rsquo;m going to be honest with you, I didn&rsquo;t know it was
a <em>rare</em> keyboard nor that it was an icon of some sort. I just liked the design
and bought it for a cheap price as it was the cooler PS/2 keyboard I could find
there.</p>
<p>After selling my <em>Model M</em> way cheaper than I should (ðŸ˜­) I got a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X_series#X230">ThinkPad
X230</a></strong> that I used for about 10 years or so. I really liked the feeling of the
keyboard and even tried to mod it to use the X220 but I have the unpopular
opinion that the X230 has the best keyboard.</p>
<p>While using my <em>X230</em> I finally discovered what a mechanical keyboard is <del>and
instantly regretted my decisions on the <em>Model M</em></del> and got a <strong><a href="https://row.hyperx.com/pt-br/products/hyperx-alloy-fps-pro-mechanical-gaming-keyboard">HyperX Alloy FPS
Pro</a></strong> with <em>Cherry MX Blue</em> switches for a steal. For the price I paid it was an
actually OK keyboard, however the full price was not worth it in my opinion. I
found the switch too heavy for hours of typing and the sound was just&hellip; weird.
I can&rsquo;t explain but for me it was not that pleasant type on it. Anyway, I ended
up selling it too.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="current-keyboard">Current keyboard</h2>
<p>My current keyboard is the <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-hot-swappable-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K2 Version 2</a>. It&rsquo;s Wireless, Hot-swappable
(meaning that I can <em>swap</em> the switches), Compact layout (84 keys<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>) and
Gateron G Red Switch (pre-lubed).</p>
<p>Some things I learned with this keyboard is that I more fond of linear switches
than clicky/tactile ones. The thing that bothered me the most is that the
keycaps accumulated a lot of grease and started to get too shiny<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="future-keyboards">Future Keyboards</h2>
<h3 id="corne-v3">Corne V3</h3>
<p>One of the first things you discover when you start to look after ergonomic
keyboards is that you can build one yourself. There is a multitude of
communities, projects and contents over the internet.</p>
<p>I really liked some models:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep">Sweep</a> is a <em>34 keys</em> split keyboard. I wanted a bit more keys, so I
discarded this one.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/diepala/cantor/">Cantor</a> is a <em>42 keys</em> split keyboard. The problem with this one is that I
couldn&rsquo;t find the required low-profile switches for cheap, so I discarded
this option. However, it was my favorite design!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foostan/crkbd">Corne</a> is a <em>36 keys</em> split keyboard. This is probably the most famous split
keyboard. I chose it because it was basically the cheapest option for me and
also had more keys than Sweep.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although I bought everything needed to start soldering the Corne together, my
country&rsquo;s post office probably lost my PCB during delivery. So I don&rsquo;t have much
to say about, if they happen to deliver it I might write about my experience
soldering it or just straight out buy the <a href="https://keyhive.xyz/shop/corne-v3">complete kit from KeyHive</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sza-moonlader-mark-i">SZA Moonlader Mark I</h3>
<p>At the moment I&rsquo;m waiting for my <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/">Moonlander SZA Mark I</a> to arrive. I didn&rsquo;t do
much research on the keyboard as I wasn&rsquo;t intending on buying one (too expensive
here) and instead I got one as a gift! Given this, I thought it would be cool to wait
for a cool unboxing experience to a novel technology for me.</p>
<h2 id="drinking-the-colemak-kool-aid">Drinking the Colemak Kool-Aid</h2>
<p>Considering this huge introduction, my conclusion was that I should probably
take advantage of this new keyboard form I&rsquo;m getting and learn a new keyboard
layout. This might give me some benefits upon my wrist injuries and make typing
less painful.</p>
<p>I was between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout">Dvorak</a> and <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> but the thing is, all the discussions around
these layouts seemed to be mostly about personal preferences so I decided to
pick one with the most sensible technique: <strong>the coin flip</strong> and the coin told me
to go with Colemak.</p>
<p>Through my small research I found out that Colemak ships by default on most
Linux distros and it works very good with other languages (Brazilian Portuguese
ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·).</p>
<p>I guess that the only thing left is to practice typing on it now!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never learned how to touch type correctly and as such I only use at most 3 fingers on each hand.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
