    <div><p>One of the most amazing things about figuring out the <a href="https://marcosmagueta.com/blog/method-worship/">essence of something</a>,
the thing that is constant regardless of the instance you are currently
holding, is to <a href="../generalistspecialist/">discover it in an unexpected place</a>. Everything else changed, all
the details, but the permanence within change is still there. The web of instances can
then be combined in a single explanation to get your point across.</p>
<p>Better yet is to be able to tell a short story of the abstract and generic
phenomena materializing itself in front of you. Today, I would like to share
something of this nature.</p>
<h2 id="the-quality-without-a-name">The Quality Without a Name</h2>
<p>One of the most striking things about the book <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf">Patterns of Software</a> is its hypothesis for the first
half of the piece.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_P._Gabriel">Gabriel</a> got in touch with the literature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>, someone from the architecture
realm. The lisper then identified that the property Alexander was seeking to define and to
explore, the so-called quality without a name, is something relatable in software as well.</p>
<p>The story the book describes is one of investigation. Gabriel, by dissecting Alexander&rsquo;s work,
aims to explore and detail this mysterious property whilst making parallels with software development.
If Alexander wanted all his buildings to have this precious property,
our software would also benefit from having it.
The problem, however, is that this property is so vague and foggy that we have a hard time defining
it in precise terms. Alexander&rsquo;s goal,
with an attempt to define it, was to find a mechanical process or recipe that would guarantee the final
product to have it. At the time, for this particular goal, they failed (both Alexander and Gabriel),
although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_Order">more steps to this story have been made since then</a>. But, for the purposes of this post, any recent
developments on this inquiry are not necessary.</p>
<p>The quality without a name&rsquo;s major quirk is peculiar. Some people claim they are able to <em>identify</em> it,
even though they can&rsquo;t define it. This selective group of people uses a bunch of vague terms to talk about it,
such as &ldquo;elegant&rdquo;, &ldquo;divine&rdquo;, &ldquo;it just clicks&rdquo;, or &ldquo;simple&rdquo;. In fact, one could argue that the entire
pursuit of simplicity is a major cover-up to actually mean the quality without a name instead. Simplicity,
by being such a vague and imprecise term as the quality without a name, fits the bill just nicely.</p>
<h2 id="craftsmanship">Craftsmanship</h2>
<p>Think about it. Everyone understands the problems C programs make you undertake, yet many people
use it under the premise that it is the language that &ldquo;keeps things simple&rdquo;. Of course, once you
understand that the <a href="../runtime/">correct abstractions</a> for the correct problems are <a href="../pragmatism/">the actual source of simplicity</a>,
the lack of expressiveness of C starts to fall apart, and its simplicity turns into scarcity.
The workarounds start to feel like patch-ups due to the limitations on expressing one&rsquo;s will; after all
<a href="../abstractionthreads/">it is the computer&rsquo;s job to encode the solutions of the mind</a> and not the other way around.</p>
<p>Still, there is something in there, in those C programs, that if done right, and the problem arranged in a way
that the limitations are distant from your sight, it <em>just clicks</em>. And you know it. I know it. You and I
look at the same code snippet, and a current of satisfaction sparkles. Sadly, even though
our eyes are shining with joy, our Javascript friend thinks we are going crazy. We are lunatics. And worse,
we think the same of him, but for a different reason.</p>
<p>A follow-up hypothesis of mine, this one more speculative, is that one&rsquo;s level of blindness about this quality
is at least related to one&rsquo;s experience writing software and caring about what is being written. The variety
of principles and techniques learned throughout your career starts to build in you some sort
of <em>craftsmanship</em>. This polishing process starts to add to you a sense of taste and caring,
which leads to the development of expertise. Experts are great at judging products of their realm quickly,
especially when identifying the great ones.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/anecdoteScoping/craftsmanship.png" width="80%"/>
</figure>

<p>Even more speculative, I would even say that for some people, the expertise gained is just a consequence, not the target.
The real effect of the acquired taste is the pursuit of something <em>worthwhile</em>. Something <em>beautiful</em>.
Something <em>meaningful</em>. Something words cannot describe. Yes, more vague words. Thus, it is not a
coincidence that little cracks here and there start to bother those people. This explains why
popularity or hot trends in software are of no interest to those people for the sake of being popular:
they seek the right tool for the job, regardless of whether it has 5 or 50 years of age. Big tech companies using
such something also means nothing: usually real art is made on an individual basis, not on big corporate
conglomerates. It should be a surprise to no one that something with a bigger craftsmanship
spirit, similar to the descriptions in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/553267">Dealers of Lightning</a> and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/539452">The Soul of a New Machine</a>, is the kind of place
where big innovations are made. If you aim for greatness, money comes as a consequence if rightfully managed.
The other way around does not work by principle; the rule of thumb becomes stagnation and bad designs. Exceptions to
this latter rule are made by cheating the game somehow.</p>
<h2 id="scoping">Scoping</h2>
<p>Here I was on a Friday night, 02/13/2026, doing some pair programming with my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-pinotti-jr/">Marinho</a> on our hobby
project, <a href="https://github.com/dont-rely-on-nulls/karuta">Karuta</a>. We were implementing scoping for our ML-like module system. During
this endeavor, we got stuck on a particular issue: refactoring.</p>
<p>The code being refactored was centered around lookup functions for our signatures, modules, and predicates.
Last time we touched that code, we created something capable of identifying if something is in scope to be
used at that moment, and if not, errors would be reported to the user. That was it. Happy and productive code.</p>
<p>However, on that particular night, we&rsquo;ve decided we wanted to be able to return <em>where</em> in the lookup process
we stopped. This artifact would be of great use for us in other parts of the compiler. The sad part: the code
was done in such a way that fulfilling this double functionality was not possible.
Something would have to change. And it was not clear to us what it was and how we would accomplish this change.</p>
<p>In hindsight, we were suffering due to the fact that <em>we care</em> about the quality without a name. This is not
something you actively care about; it starts to become natural to you after a while. To put it in
words, here&rsquo;s a slightly changed quote from a favorite movie of mine that perfectly describes our situation:
<br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This ain&rsquo;t no dead piece of text.
Code&rsquo;s a living breathing thing.
She&rsquo;s alive. You feel her
talking to you, telling you what
she wants, what she needs. All you
gotta do is listen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we tried to listen. We stopped writing and started looking at the code, line by line. Our brains
were trying to identify what was needed in there that would not only solve the problem but <em>also</em> solve it
in a nice way, whatever that means. And it builds anxiety: you actually hear the code telling you something
is wrong, but figuring out how to implement what it needs is tricky. Sometimes the language you are working
on does not have the feature. Sometimes the solution can be found in an <a href="https://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/dynamic-binding.html#implementation">obscure code snippet another nerd made</a>,
but you may not be aware of it. Sometimes you just don&rsquo;t know, yet you know something <em>must</em> exist to fix it.
Some situations are so bad that the telling actually morphs into screaming, and you know in every inch of your being
that something is fundamentally wrong with it, even though you can&rsquo;t really express or point to where and why.
As frustrating as it is, this usually leads to the best solutions to problems in my experience.</p>
<p>One could say: &ldquo;just copy paste the code, and try your best to make the common parts common functions&rdquo;,
which was an option. But thinking of using that solution felt like a crime. Something without honor.
Something that does not seem right. Something that does not <em>feel</em> right. Yes, more vague words. And the craziest
part: it was mutual. Both Marinho and I felt it, even though we would not be able to explain it
to a stranger.</p>
<p>This happened multiple times already with me, especially when doing hobby projects. And I am especially grateful
Marinho is also able to identify it; otherwise nobody would understand the standards of nobody. Lo and behold,
we were right: after looking at some versions of these functions, written just for the sake of comparison,
something came out of it. Something that seemed to fit it nicely. Something we were proud of. Something we would
like to hang on the wall. Yes, more vague words. A beautiful generic function using polymorphic variants that could
perform double duty with a great and understandable API.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>One may look at this post and say I am crazy. Fair enough. I accept that possibility. But I don&rsquo;t think I am.
Alexander noticed this in architecture, Gabriel in software, and so many movies lead us to believe that
craftsmanship in many other areas has something special. Something that, at one point, we thought machines
could reproduce. We were wrong. Everybody knows that a commodity does not have the same value as something
hand-made by an artisan. Now we think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding">AI can</a>. Are we wrong on that one as well? Time will tell, I assure you
of that.</p>
<p>What I do know is that my expectations are clear: I am prepared to have conversations with my code more
frequently as I progress into reading about code and writing more code. The more techniques I acquire, the more it will talk
to me. The more egregious mistakes I see, the louder it will get. This unilateral communication sounds like
a curse, but it isn&rsquo;t: there is nothing more satisfying than to see your craft come into fruition leveraging
everything you know and everything you trained yourself to perfect. It is as if the entire quiet time you devoted
yourself to your work actually paid off for once; even though you know the pursuit will never end. If you can hear it,
you should be grateful. I know I am.
<br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No? Maybe you can&rsquo;t hear it
then. Maybe you ought to start
hitting those books.</p>
