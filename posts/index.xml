      <description>During 2022, a lot of things happened.

This post served as training of a topic I had the intention of talking about in the final thesis &amp;ndash; something that ended up not happening. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a presentation on Dr.Nekoma about the topic, given how interesting it is. The following is the original post.
Introduction Here I present a very descriptive explanation of a solution to a simple example problem.</description>
