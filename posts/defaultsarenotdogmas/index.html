    <div><p>The ability to understand and study language-agnostic concepts is invaluable.
Although most of the time when programming we are interacting with language-specific
features, some ideas float beyond any palpable implementation.</p>
<p>Thus, it is important to not only distinguish those but also to identify which ones
we should use to create <em>defaults</em> when approaching other technologies. This, however, isn&rsquo;t
to say we will be unconditionally married to them &ndash; effectively transforming them
into <em>dogmas</em>. Allowing that to happen causes a myriad of bad outcomes, and I want to explore this
dilemma in this post.</p>
<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>
<p>As almost always when talking to engineers, the most effective way to explain something abstract is
to show an example or instance of the general idea. For this post, I think the relational model and
immutability in programming languages are the perfect candidates. Those two topics have something
in common: their discussions of trade-offs do not happen, or rather <em>should</em> not happen, in the
realm of implementation.</p>
<h3 id="relational-model">Relational Model</h3>
<p>The relational model, the one that we are supposed to use as the <strong>foundation</strong> for relational databases,
is about guaranteeing data&rsquo;s correctness; established relations in the model represent real facts
that we are interested in. Such a model works as a logical layer when designing a system and, more importantly,
doing so puts abstract ideas to orbit around us. We touch on the mathematical understanding of what is a relation,
and we start seeing it ontologically, i.e., what are the relations that actually <strong>exist</strong> in the domain
we are studying/modeling.</p>
<p>All this baggage comes before any sort of code is written and it can, or maybe even
<em>should</em>, be studied and understood on its own before the implementation starts. With that done, we can
later assess the value of the properties we are gaining by following the model. This matters because a situation
may come, as we will talk about later, that a trade must happen, and we can&rsquo;t properly trade anything without having
at least an educated guess on <em>what</em> exactly we are trading; what is on the table?</p>
<h3 id="immutability">Immutability</h3>
<p>It has been a while since the programming domain started flirting with the domain of mathematics [1, 2, 3].
Ideally, the former is supposed to absorb the lessons learned from the latter. One of those lessons is about
the use of <em>immutability</em> when programming.</p>
<p>Using mutability in code makes it difficult for us to use <em>equational reasoning</em> [1, 4].
Here&rsquo;s the intuition on why this technique is valuable: it allows us to swap names/labels with their definitions without
breaking anything, but only when dealing with functions and structures in a mathematical sense.
A function that takes a mutable reference to a structure may be affected by <em>something else</em> that also
has access to this reference, hence equational reasoning is at risk.</p>
<p>In terms of code, Bartosz showed an example of why functions with side-effects
don&rsquo;t support this process [4] with the following C snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">square</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> x;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">counter</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> c <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> c<span style="color:#f92672">++</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">double</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> square(counter());
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Because effects are happening, the following rewrite won&rsquo;t produce the same result as before:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">double</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> counter() <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> counter();
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, we can evaluate what this means more broadly: mutability introduces an extra need for understanding
more code in your application, especially if concurrency is being used. There may be code spatially very far from
the original function that can interact with it, and now a new moving piece has been added to the <em>context</em> that
we need to care about. There are ways to mitigate this cost, such as having a smart enough compiler, specific
abstractions to deal with it, and great organization of the code base.</p>
<h2 id="trade-offs">Trade-Offs</h2>
<p>One would be a fool to believe that after studying the concepts mentioned, or any other concept, the next move
should be to make them dogmas one should follow &ndash; you strictly follow them blindly without being open to discussion
and you are willing to fight over them in all possible scenarios. Solid foundations give you the luxury of having
a solid set of defaults. Sometimes, however, these defaults need to be exchanged by another important factor &ndash; and
we call this situation &ldquo;making a <em>trade-off</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Among all the common trade-offs one usually faces, e.g., deadlines, costs, a very common threat to both concepts,
relational model and immutability, is <em>performance</em>. Some applications
have performance as a mandatory requirement in order to solve the problems they target. It may be the case that
any use of immutable code will imply that you can&rsquo;t deliver the project following its performance criteria. When
such an event happens, then it is time to change your default behavior: you take an educated trade, being aware
of what you are losing. I would be completely happy to lose equational reasoning in my application if that means
I will be able to deliver what we promised with the product in the best possible way. If mutable code poses
a good fight against my default, I&rsquo;m more than satisfied with using it to solve engineering problems.</p>
<h3 id="lyceum">Lyceum</h3>
<p>As an example of this practice, I would like to share a case I had when working in <a href="https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/lyceum">Lyceum</a>, a game I&rsquo;ve been developing with
my friends recently. This online game uses Zig as the client/front-end language and Erlang as the server language.</p>
<p>The client-side will leverage <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib">raylib</a> as the library to make the graphics of the game. This being originally a C library,
it tangles pure and impure computations very deeply, and we discussed whether we should use it the way was intended to be used.
On that meeting, we discussed how/what we should have to do to make that happen and what would be problems that we would
cause ourselves in each approach. After the deliberation, all designs we were able to come up with caused serious pain
when drawing elements on the screen, to the point that we explicitly traded equational reasoning.</p>
<p>As it turned out, we made the right choice. The final design of the front-end code turned out great, way beyond our
expectations. Part of the reason it ended up great was writing raylib code the way an immutability purist would never
allow: there&rsquo;s a heavy mix of effectful and effect-free computations.</p>
<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<p>As a final point of interest, there is the conversation about the culture the community portrays.
It usually goes like this: &ldquo;Nobody using X does that, they all do Y&rdquo; and they discourage you from
using language-agnostic defaults from the get-go, rather than convincing you that there are better reasons
you should drop your initial approach.</p>
<p>Instead of following this recommendation blindly, the ideal reaction is to ask why the community decided
to make such a convention. There may be good reasons for that: maybe X is <em>only</em> used in a context where
performance matters, hence it has set Y as the default. But there may also be questionable or even
bad reasons: matters of taste, the presence of biased approaches, the lack of or misunderstanding of alternative approaches.
Not surprisingly, educating ourselves further with reliable sources will give us insights and maybe even change
our set of defaults, either generally or for specific technologies, in an unexpected manner.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Only with an unstoppable process of educating ourselves we will reach good default choices. We need to
be open to having our minds changed if we see the reasoning on the justification; we can&rsquo;t let dogmas infiltrate.
Even if we face nothing of substance to change our defaults, we should always be humble and be willing to listen
and accept that we can be wrong.
There certainly will be situations in which whatever default we use will be the wrong tool for the job.
The endless process of studying and honing our craft will give us the epiphany of finding the correct one.</p>
