The plan was for me to make a toy example of one of the professor\u0026rsquo;s ideas using this library because of its power and generality.\nPrior to this project, I presented the subject for the class based on the original paper published by Simon and Ralf [1]. My impression after the reading, which is also the one that I attempted to portray to my peers, is that the usefulness of the method came at the cost of complexity of understanding and the use of unsafe operations.","tags":["lesson","technical"],"title":"Don't be a Hero, join a League"},{"date":"2023-07-09","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/beyondhackers/","summary":"The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric S. Raymond is a perfect union of philosophy, economics, and software development culture. The reverberations of his theory are fascinating and explain much more than just why you should care about open-source software.\nNeedless to say that I highly recommend the reading, there are aspects that he identified within the Hacker Culture that explain more than meets the naked eye. I\u0026rsquo;m here to suggest a few possible explanations for such observations and how the connection between those aspects and a hacker is more than just making money via coding.","tags":["lesson","recommendation"],"title":"Beyond Hackers"},{"date":"2023-03-06","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/masters/","summary":"Starting in March, I will start a master\u0026rsquo;s program at University of Bras√≠lia, the same university where I graduated almost a year ago. The thought process that I went in order to make such a decision is not conventional and I think it is worth sharing it.\nSoftware Industry As we know, the software industry values academic achievements only in very specific situations, usually involving big companies with very complicated projects to push, such as the next Apple M3 processor and Windows 12 at Microsoft.","tags":["lesson"],"title":"Why Masters?"},{"date":"2023-01-18","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/careaboutart/","summary":"In this post, I want to talk about how a movie that I watched years ago added some value in the current version of myself. How, now that I\u0026rsquo;m much older than back then, I see that the movie showed to me that art is much more important that I thought. How, even in my profession, there can be a noble purpose.\nRetrospective Sometimes we remember our infancy. We remember the toys we used to play with, the people we used to interact with, the lessons that we learned along the way (usually in the most painful way), and also we remember what we used to watch.","tags":["entertainment","lesson"],"title":"Do we still care about Art?"},{"date":"2023-01-15","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/bestidea2022/","summary":"During 2022, a lot of things happened. I graduated from university, got my first job, and moved to a new one, the second one being my first international experience within the programming industry. While working, I also continued the development of my graduation thesis with the help of my friend and mentor Edil Medeiros. All these experiences were great on their own, but they don\u0026rsquo;t even get close to how good the idea of a study group was.","tags":["lesson"],"title":"My best idea of 2022"}],
