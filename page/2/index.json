As an example, this week such a situation occurred \u0026mdash; I heard someone saying something along those lines about Haskell. They see the added abstractions as a way to add fanciness for the sake of fanciness into your project, without any logical practical reason for doing so.\nEver since I understood why programmers left assembly languages behind, I understood that this popular take is nothing more than just a misconception on why we seek new concepts.","tags":["lesson"],"title":"Let us all be Pragmatists"},{"date":"2023-09-30","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/story/","summary":"When you find the same principle being applied to multiple domains, with completely different contexts, that is when you gotta watch out for such a principle. Ask yourself: how universal is this? Should I expect it to appear again in a domain near these ones? How easily does it spread to other ideas?\nI suffered from this internal questioning after reading Building a StoryBrand by Donald Miller, a suggestion from my friend Eduardo Bellani.","tags":["lesson","recommendation"],"title":"Is it all about the Story?"},{"date":"2023-09-01","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/teaching/","summary":"During my vacation time from University, my mentor Edil proposed I teach undergraduate students in the following semester. He would be doing the third edition of his Functional Programming (FP) with Haskell course \u0026ndash; the one that introduced me to FP in 2021. The idea was that he would give me some guidelines and I would have the freedom to create my own material and teaching strategy for the first 2 classes of the course.","tags":["lesson"],"title":"Teaching is Fun"},{"date":"2023-08-21","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/ooptypeclasses/","summary":"The main benefit of exploring different programming paradigms is to learn how to build bridges. You have your preferences and by playing with the competitors, you are able to see where your preferences fall apart and vice-versa. Eventually, the mastery of both sides will allow you to syntatically and semantically connect the same concepts across different worlds of programming.\nThe story goes as follows: suppose you have a function that is generic enough in order to be worth it to generalize it to other types of structures, given that some constraints on it will be guaranteed.","tags":["technical"],"title":"OOP-style Typeclasses"},{"date":"2023-07-17","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://duing.dev/posts/runtime/","summary":"Recently, I experimented with SYB (Scrap Your Boilerplate) in the Haskell programming language for a master\u0026rsquo;s course. The plan was for me to make a toy example of one of the professor\u0026rsquo;s ideas using this library because of its power and generality.\nPrior to this project, I presented the subject for the class based on the original paper published by Simon and Ralf [1]. My impression after the reading, which is also the one that I attempted to portray to my peers, is that the usefulness of the method came at the cost of complexity of understanding and the use of unsafe operations.","tags":["lesson","technical"],"title":"Don't be a Hero, join a League"}],
