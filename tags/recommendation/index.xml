      <description>You envision a generic way to implement a particular functionality. In the process of implementing it, however, you notice that some pieces of the code really bother you. Not because they are wrong, stuff works and all, but because it feels like you had to bend the tool you are using to get the result. It is not the most pleasant type of hacking. This post is about an experience of this phenomena.</description>

      <description>When you find the same principle being applied to multiple domains, with completely different contexts, that is when you gotta watch out for such a principle. Ask yourself: how universal is this? Should I expect it to appear again in a domain near these ones? How easily does it spread to other ideas?
I suffered from this internal questioning after reading Building a StoryBrand by Donald Miller, a suggestion from my friend Eduardo Bellani.</description>

      <description>The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric S. Raymond is a perfect union of philosophy, economics, and software development culture. The reverberations of his theory are fascinating and explain much more than just why you should care about open-source software.
Needless to say that I highly recommend the reading, there are aspects that he identified within the Hacker Culture that explain more than meets the naked eye. I&amp;rsquo;m here to suggest a few possible explanations for such observations and how the connection between those aspects and a hacker is more than just making money via coding.</description>
