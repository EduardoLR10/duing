      <description>Retrospective Sometimes we remember our infancy. We remember the toys we used to play with, the people we used to interact with, the lessons that we learned along the way (usually in the most painful way), and also we remember what we used to watch.
I was talking to a friend the other day and she asked me about what I used to watch when young, i.e., between 10 to 15 years of age.</description>

      <description>During 2022, a lot of things happened. I graduated from university, got my first job, and moved to a new one, the second one being my first international experience within the programming industry. While working, I also continued the development of my graduation thesis with the help of my friend and mentor Edil Medeiros. All these experiences were great on their own, but they don&amp;rsquo;t even get close to how good the idea of a study group was.</description>
